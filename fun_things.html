      <p>Bonfires and smores, I mean what could go wrong? Have a tall glass of spiked cider on the side, some good music and great company
        and you are in for a memorable night filled with laughter.

        This place called Cedarpoint is a fun and spooky place to go to with friends. It is an amusement park with lots of haunted houses. Just make sure you get your tickets in advance and it would be helpful
        to get a fastpass ticket so you don't have to wait in line.
