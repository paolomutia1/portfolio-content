      <p>Our football team is pretty good. It's a Division 1 school afterall. The games that you have 
        to go to are the home games against Michigan State University and Ohio. The rivalry between these two schools are 
        insane. You will see a bunch of tailgate parties all over the place. If you're new to parties like that, they are
        basically a place where people each (usually hotdogs or burgers) and drink. There will also be alot of signs saying you 
        should drink and party responsbily, which you totally should. You'll see alot of people wearing Umich gear. And even if 
        you don't support football, you might as well wear a Umich T-shirt or sweater to blend into the crowd. 
      </p> <br> 
      <p>
        But, if I'm being honest, I've never been to a football game or tailgate party. I got season tickets for the football games
        last year, but never got around to attending a game where you are crowded next to a bunch of drink college students. It's a little overrated
        for me, honestly. I like the idea of going to a tailgate party, but not being surrounded by a bunch of drunk colleagues. And I don't really
        like hotdogs or burgers. I'd rather spend my Saturday morning cooking my own breakfast and doing my own thing. Football culture is 
        such a phenomena in America. One where I don't feel the need to attend, but hey! It could be a fun to do for your friends to experience! 
      </p> <br> 
      <p>Try it and let me know how it goes!</p>

      <p>Pride night! Hands down, this is where you need to be for Fall Break! </p> <br> 
      <p> My friends and I rented an AirBnb very last minute. Don't do what we did! We ended up in the middle of the gun range! 
        I did end up learning how to shoot a rifle by the end of the weekend, but still, I didn't need to watch a horry movie with my friends to be 
        scared because we felt like we were in one already. 
      </p> <br> 
      <p>Anyway, fall break is usually when Pride night happens in Tranverse City! There is this one bar in the entire city that everyone will go to
        And trust me, it is so much fun! Definitely beats the Friday Gay nights at Necto, which I haven't attended since I was in college here. Big No! 
      </p> <br>
      <p>But what made that night very memorable for me were the incredibly cheap drinks, like $5 for a Moscow Mule? Yes please!</p> <br>
      <p>When I heard that price, I turned to my friend and both our eyes widened as if it was about to pop out our heads. Then we pulled
        out cards and ordered some more. Drinks are cheap during Pride Night at Traverse City! 
      </p>

      <p>Bonfires and smores, I mean what could go wrong? Have a tall glass of spiked cider on the side, some good music and great company
        and you are in for a memorable night filled with laughter. 
      </p> <br> 
      <p>
        Okay, so I threw a surprise birthday house party for a really good friend of mine, David. I basically invited his entire graduate 
        cohort. I don't know how we fit in the house but we did! The party was amazing because I hosted it, I had desserts ready, drinks, and 
        warm appetizers ready for everyone. I sectioned it in different parts of the house that each had different themes and music going on. 
      </p> <br> 
      <p>It was a whole experience! So, if you ever hear that I'm throwing a party. You must come!</p> <br> 
      <p>Anyway, the bonfire and smores is just the best fall thing to do! Especially at a party! at the end of the night when everyone 
        is gone and all the people that are left and the real ones, you must light the wood and being the bonfire ritual. 
        I feel like bonfires a great place to start conversations and get to know someone. You can tell funny stories to each other about
        what happened during the party, who got the most drunk. But no matter what, the conversation keeps going until the fire dies. 
      </p> <br> 
      <p>While the conversations are going on, you can also take a little skewer and place a marshmallow on it and toast it. After that,
        you can take the graham crackers and the Hershey chocolate bar and create a delicious dessert called a Smore! It's warm, sweet, gooey,
        and it feels like someone just gave you a hug. Delicious! I thought I fell in love with a girl when I saw her eat one. 
      </p> <br> 
      <p> But nope, I'm still gay!</p>

      <p>Okay, so I have yet to go hear, but I heard it was really fun! Especially during Halloween. My advice is to get those fast-pass tickets so you 
        don't have to wait in line for long to ride a ride or go through a little haunted mansion. Because it is Halloween everyone wants to go here. 
        So, just plan ahead a couple weeks before it is actually Halloween to go here, maybe two weekends before? 
      </p> <br> 
      <p> But! If you do go here, let me know how it is! Or just take me with you, but be forewarned, I scream three octaves higher than a soprano singer!
