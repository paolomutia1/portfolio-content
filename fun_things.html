        <p>Our football team is pretty good. It's a Division 1 school afterall. The games that you have 
          to go to are the home games against Michigan State University and Ohio. The rivalry between these two schools are 
          insane. You will see a bunch of tailgate parties all over the place. If you're new to parties like that, they are
          basically a place where people each (usually hotdogs or burgers) and drink. There will also be alot of signs saying you 
          should drink and party responsbily, which you totally should. You'll see alot of people wearing Umich gear. And even if 
          you don't support football, you might as well wear a Umich T-shirt or sweater to blend into the crowd.

        <p>Pride night! Hands down, this is where you need to be for Fall Break! 
          My friends and I rented an AirBnb very last minute. Don't do what we did! We ended up in the middle of the gun range! 
          I did end up learning how to shoot a rifle by the end of the weekend, but still, I didn't need to watch a horry movie with my friends to be 
          scared because we felt like we were in one already. 
        
          Anyway, fall break is usually when Pride night happens in Tranverse City! There is this one bar in the entire city that everyone will go to
          And trust me, it is so much fun! Definitely beats the Friday Gay nights at Necto, which I haven't attended since I was in college here. Big No! 
        
          But what made that night very memorable for me were the incredibly cheap drinks, like $5 for a Moscow Mule? Yes please!
          When I heard that price, I turned to my friend and both our eyes widened as if it was about to pop out our heads. Then we pulled
          out cards and ordered some more. Drinks are cheap during Pride Night at Traverse City!

        <p>Bonfires and smores, I mean what could go wrong? Have a tall glass of spiked cider on the side, some good music and great company
          and you are in for a memorable night filled with laughter. 
        
          A bonfire and smores is just the best fall thing to do! Especially at a party! at the end of the night when everyone 
          is gone and all the people that are left and the real ones, you must light the wood and being the bonfire ritual. 
          I feel like bonfires a great place to start conversations and get to know someone. You can tell funny stories to each other about
          what happened during the party, who got the most drunk. But no matter what, the conversation keeps going until the fire dies. 
        
          While the conversations are going on, you can also take a little skewer and place a marshmallow on it and toast it. After that,
          you can take the graham crackers and the Hershey chocolate bar and create a delicious dessert called a Smore! It's warm, sweet, gooey,
          and it feels like someone just gave you a hug. Delicious! I thought I fell in love with a girl when I saw her eat one. 
        
          But nope, I'm still gay!

        <p>Okay, so I have yet to go hear, but I heard it was really fun! Especially during Halloween. My advice is to get those fast-pass tickets so you 
        don't have to wait in line for long to ride a ride or go through a little haunted mansion. Because it is Halloween everyone wants to go here. 
        So, just plan ahead a couple weeks before it is actually Halloween to go here, maybe two weekends before? 
        
        But! If you do go here, let me know how it is! Or just take me with you, but be forewarned, I scream three octaves higher than a soprano singer!
