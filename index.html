      <h1><strong>A little bit about me</strong></h1><br>
      <p>
        Paolo Mutia has experience in science communication and inclusive, collaborative decision making in the nongovernmental sector. 
        Mutia built coalitions of Virginians that helped pass the Virginia Clean Economy Act, 
        the stateâ€™s first major step towards climate action. Mutiaâ€™s leadership roles in the nongovernmental sector focus on inclusive, 
        collaborative decision making. With skills in campaign management, communicating with specific stakeholder groups, 
        and a technical background in environmental health and science, Mutia uses an interdisciplinary approach to engage with 
        communities and help them develop environmental policy. Mutia is pursuing a Master of Public Policy and Master of Science in 
        Information at the University of Michigan. Between his studies at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy and the School of 
        Information, he is interested in what public policy looks like that centers justice and equity at the forefront in the age of 
        information technology and the rapid development of new technology. Mutia enjoys designing, building, and enhancing technology 
        that are inclusive and equitable for everyone, especially for historically marginalized groups in environmental sustainability.

      <p>I'll be covering topics about things you can do during that fall with your friends, that will include the Dexter cider mill, food, and places to go to.</p>
      <p><br>
        I think that fall in Umich is one of the best seasons of the year. I'm from the East Coast, Virginia specifically, and so I 
        have some experience of fun things to do during the fall. But, since I came here to Ann Arbor, MI, the fall vibes here go hard. 
        Maybe it's because when winter sets in, no one is really go out. Do take advantage of the fall weather!
