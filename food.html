      <h1>These are some of my favorite fall desserts and drinks!</h1> <br> 
      <p>So my favorite fall drink is the Pumpkin Spice latte. I don't have it all the time, but something to just try when fall hits you know? 
        So what is drink? The Pumpkin Spice Latte is a coffee drink made with steamed milk, espresso, and sometimes sugar (always ask for less sugar) 
        topped with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice. The drink is most popularly affiliated with Starbucks because they introduced around the early 
        2000's, at least that's when I remember my parents first giving me a taste of it when I was a kid. 
        Since then, other local coffee shops have copied it and done their own little twist. </p> <br>
      <p>If you have never tried of these, I would suggest visit a pastry shop nearby or a coffee shop, they usually have most of these. </p> <br>
      <p>The only thing you might not find are the smores. If you go to the fun things page, you'll hear more about me talking about making S'mores!</p> <br>
      <p>S'mores are generally cooked over a campfire, but they can also be produced at home in an oven, over the flame of a wood-burning fireplace, 
        in a microwave, using a s'mores-making kit, or in a panini press. A marshmallow is roasted over a fire using a metal or wooden skewer 
        until it is golden brown. Traditionally, marshmallows are gooey but not burnt, however marshmallows can range from barely warm 
        to scorched based on individual liking and heating duration. Between the graham crackers, the roasted marshmallow is 
        sandwiched between two halves of a graham cracker and a piece of chocolate (or with chocolate on both top and bottom).</p>
