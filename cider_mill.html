      <h1>History of the Dexter Cider Mill</h1> <br> 
      <p>The Dexter Cider Mill, which has been family owned and run since 1886, has been serving Dexter, the greater Ann Arbor region, 
        and its guests for 136 years. They are Michigan's oldest continually functioning cider mill, a status they are very proud of 
        and take very seriously. They love what we do and are thrilled to be able to share their family's passion and 
        heritage with all of their visitors.
      </p> <br> 
      <p>The Dexter cider mill is still in operation and is a proud member of the Michigan Cider Makers' Guild. 
        With a strong desire to preserve their heritage, the Dexter Cider Mill has made minimal modifications to its 
        procedures over the last 136 years.</p> <br> 
      <p>From the traditional oak press to the processing of a variety of local Michigan apples to make our their unpasteurized cider, to their 
        natural environment along the Huron River... it's journey back in time to how life used to be and have always been for them. 
        If you want to see a piece of Michigan history, you've come to the perfect spot!</p> <br>
